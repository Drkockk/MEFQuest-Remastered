What did I do... This program has taken over me.
...
Instead of brainwashing young people, I should have educated them. How did you realize what was happening?
Professor Drias, told me everything before being captured. Thanks to him, I wasn't affected by anything.
...
It's not too late to correct what you have done. How can we fix the students?
We can fix the students with a program called "Yetkin-Gencler." but you need to defeat the Rector first.
But we have a big problem. Mr. Muhammer is too powerful for me. How am I supposed to do that?
I know how to defeat him... Take this...
Huh? A full scholarship how is this going to help?
He thinks just like me... We have this vision that our university is on par with others like Ozyegin and Sabanci
Are you serious?
Yes this is why we increased the schools tuition fee two fold.. Only thing he cares about is the money he can squeeze out of the students!
But we already know how that how that turned out
He does not care. It may have caused MEF losing all its reputation and end up losing many of its students with many vacant slots left open...
...
His ultimate plan must be to destroy the university and run away with all the money at the end...
I must stop him with the power of this scholarship.
