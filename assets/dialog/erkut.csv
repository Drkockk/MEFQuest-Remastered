Ah... Finally I have found you. It was such a surprise such a failure like you could reach here.
...
But it ends here I fear. I'll make sure that you will join the others after I defeat you.
Hahaha it's surprising you came this far.
You are poisoned by the power granted you by the people who have trusted you!
...
You have turned all the students, all the professors into your puppets. Today your reign of manipulation will end, I will end it.
You? Are you going to do that all by yourself? Don't be so silly now. You are just another small error in my system, and I will fix it.
I was a big fan of your works, your efforts on making people go beyond their true potentials.
...
And you underestimate your student professor. I have found it. I foudn the ancient texts hidden in the depths of the library!
So you did it. You really entered the forbidden room. It won't change a thing anyway. Enough talking, let's end this.
Let's see.
